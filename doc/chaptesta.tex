\section{Introduction}

In bin/tests there is the file options.db3. You should copy it in the
directory bin as ''cp options.db3.. /.', and then you launch the code
after the load four test configurations appear that allow you to see
all the options in action.



\section{Test1}

The aim of test1 is to test a simple case and many options of the code
to validate them. Figure~\ref{test1conf} shows the options of the
chosen configuration.

The following figures show the results obtained. The plots are done
with Matlab and these are directly the eps files from the ifdda.m
script that are used. The advantage of matlab in this case is to give
all the figures in one go.

Because the incident field is polarized along the $y$ direction (TE),
hence the $y$ component of the field inside the sphere is the largest.

\section{Test2}

The aim of the test2 is to test a simple case and many options code to
validate them.  Figure~\ref{test2conf}. shows the options of the
chosen configuration. The illumination is done by two plane waves.

\section{Test3}

The aim of the test3 is to test the microscopy in dark field and
bright field in transmission. One studies a sphere with a radius of
500~nm and permittivity 1.5.
